# CodeWeekend-Session-5---Assignment-The assignment for this week is: - create a complete login system. The restrictions to visit (profile/dashboard) pages should be implemented, and the user shouldn't be able to visit the login page after logging in. tips: Use forms and sessions.  - Create a registration kinda form that collects the user's basic info (name, age, email, password) and photo. Upload the file to a directory/folder and display the user info in a well-designed format alongside the photo. In addition, create a link that holds the uploaded file name as GET parameter to another file and delete the file there. tips: Use forms, file uploading, and $_GET serverside array.   Note: A good practice would be to use multiple files and implement the basic concept of MVC. The HW has been explained at the end of the Session 5 video as well.  Where to submit the assignments? Push your codes to GitHub, make sure your repository is public, and share the link here under this post or send the link to Mr Asadullah Hashimi Asadullah.
